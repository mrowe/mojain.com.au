# About us

Mojain Pty Ltd was incorporated in July 2004. Since then we have provided finance, administration and IT consulting and services to numerous clients, from small local companies to well-known national brands.

We are based in the quiet, leafy suburb of Briar Hill in Melbourne's outer north east and specialise in local small businesses and sole proprietors, but also have long standing relationships with larger groups.
